 ## üìù Task Tracker Dashboard
A full-stack web application built with Node.js and Express that allows authenticated users to manage their personal To-Do lists. Users can register, log in, create tasks, and track their status.

## ‚ú® Features
Secure Authentication: User registration and login handled with JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for session management and bcrypt for secure password hashing.

User Isolation: Tasks are linked to the unique user ID (req.userid), ensuring users only see their own data.

Task Management: Users can create, view, and organize tasks.

Personalized Dashboard: Users only see tasks linked to their unique user ID.

Status Tracking: Tasks include a customizable status (Pending, Completed, In Progress).

Dynamic UI: Uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for server-side rendering and Tailwind CSS for styling.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose ODM)

Authentication: JWT, bcrypt

Templating: EJS

Styling: Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
